> __**Chapter I - Basics**__
To create **Lakkit Plugin**, you need create class that **extends Plugin class**.
At first we need import Plugin class.

```js
const Plugin = require('./../libs/plugin')
```

then, create class for your plugin

```js
class PluginName extends Plugin { }
```

Then we have to export our plugin. Let's do this by adding one line at end of the code
```js
module.exports = PluginName
```

Whole code:
```js
const Plugin = require('./../libs/plugin')
class PluginName extends Plugin
{
	// our code that we will write soon
}
module.exports = PluginName
```

Now, let's start with onEnable and onDisable events. They're very easy to create. Just create functions named `onEnable` and `onDisable`. They **must be static** - otherwise won't work.

```js
static onEnable(_server)
{
	console.log('Our plugin is enabled and working correctly!')
	server = _server
}
```
*(we don't write 'function onEnable', because it's inside class)*

**What's happening here?**
To onEnable event is passing instance of server. This instance allows us to get informations about it (players, worlds etc.).
We have to save it, Lakkit won't send it anymore. We highly recommend to create global variable called server.

Add
```js
var server = undefined
```
at top of your file

There we go, your plugin is working as expected!

> __**Chapter II - Connecting with MinecraftData and MinecraftProtocol**__
To use low-level API, we have to import MinecraftData and MinecraftProtocol. They're so useful.
MinecraftProtcol can be imported on top of file.
```js
const minecraftProtocol = require('minecraft-protocol')
```
But to use MinecraftData we need specify version. Because your plugin may runs on other version that you except, you should always take version from `server.version`.
Create global empty variable for MinecraftData at top of file
```js
var minecraftData = ''
```
And in onEnable event, let's add this line:
```js
minecraftData = require('minecraft-data')(server.version)
```
It imports MinecraftData with server's version
