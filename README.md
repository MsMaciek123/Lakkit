# Lakkit
## What?
**Lakkit** is opensource, written from scratch Minecraft Server Software. It's fully customizable and easy to use. It also aims performance. It's written in JavaScript (NodeJS)

## Why?
**Vanilla** - official Minecraft Server Software made by Mojang, it's unoptimized, but has implemented all things that exists in Minecraft. Why it's unoptimized? Because Mojang wants you to pay them for Minecraft Realms, so it's cheaper than cheapiest Minercaft Server Hosting.
There are some **forks** of Vanilla.
**CraftBukkit** - it's basically Vanilla with Bukkit API, so developers can write own plugins.
**Spigot** - fork of CraftBukkit with patches for optimization and Spigot API
**PaperSpigot** - fork of Spigot with patches for optimization and PaperSpigot API
and many other...

There are also server softwares written from scratch (using **reverse engineering**)
Glowstone (in Java, partial compatibility with CraftBukkit/Spigot plugins), Cubernite (in C++, Plugins in Lua)

We are making Lakkit for three reasons:
- For more knowledge about programming world,
- For fun,
- We think that our server software may actually be good  for low-end machines.

## When?
We really don't know :/
## Where?
